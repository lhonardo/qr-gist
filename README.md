## About

App builded with React Native that allows users to comment on a Github Gist using a QR Code

## Available Scripts

If Yarn was installed when the project was initialized, then dependencies will have been installed via Yarn, and you should probably use it to run these commands as well. Unlike dependency installation, command running syntax is identical for Yarn and NPM at the time of this writing.

### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.

### `react-native start`

Server for development mode.

### `react-native run-android` and `react-native run-ios`

Build the app and install on device

```
npm start -- --reset-cache
# or
yarn start -- --reset-cache
```
